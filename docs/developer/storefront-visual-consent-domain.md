# L1 checkpoint: visual-consent domain only

This is the first bounded domain slice of V4 L1, not the completed public-consent feature.
`StorefrontVisualConsent` is a standalone in-memory type, **not referenced by `StorefrontProfile`
or another persisted entity**. It adds no handler, public/owner DTO, controller, migration, EF
mapping, SQL constraint, permission policy, tenant database access or classification resolver.
Existing profile creation signatures and fixtures are unchanged; new standalone consent starts
with all five fields absent. Nothing is attached to, hydrated from or saved to Master yet.

EF discovers private-set scalar properties by convention even without explicit mapping edits.
For that reason this checkpoint does **not** add properties or a navigation to `StorefrontProfile`:
its EF model and required SQL columns stay unchanged. Attaching the domain state to that aggregate
must arrive with the dependent additive Master mapping/migration, not before its columns exist.

## Domain contract

- `PublicVisualProfileKey`, `PublicVisualProfileRevision`, `VisualConsentVersion`,
  `VisualConsentAcceptedAt`, `VisualConsentAcceptedByUserId` are all absent or all complete
  through domain operations. Private setters are not a database constraint or an API allowlist.
- `AcceptVisualConsent` requires an explicit `accepted=true`, an exact kebab-case key (1–64
  ASCII characters), an editorial revision `r[1-9][0-9]*` (up to 64 characters), nonempty terms
  version (up to 64 characters, no controls; outer whitespace trimmed), nonempty actor and
  non-default UTC time. Identity/revision are not trimmed, lowercased or inferred. These are
  shape checks only, not catalogue availability, permissions or legal approval.
- The terms version is separate from both publication `ConsentVersion`/CGU and the technical
  catalogue release. No private tenant classification, category or CGU value initializes consent.
- All inputs are validated before any replacement. Changing identity, editorial revision or
  visual terms requires another explicit acceptance. A same-identity/revision/terms repeat
  returns `Result.Success(false)` and preserves the first actor/time, even if a subsequent
  authorized caller supplies another actor/time. A change returns `Result.Success(true)`.
- Acceptance takes a supplied `StorefrontStatus` snapshot. Only Draft, PendingReview and Published
  are accepted; Suspended and unknown enum values reject every acceptance, including an otherwise
  idempotent repeat. That argument is **not** fresh server validation. Suspension does not erase
  existing visual proof. `WithdrawVisualConsent` clears only these five fields and needs no status
  exception or publication transition; repeating an absent withdrawal is a no-op.
- This standalone type cannot change publication, street position, moderation reasons/dates,
  branding, checkout, CGU or aggregate version. Future aggregate integration must preserve that
  isolation and ensure approval after withdrawal never restores old consent.
- The methods do not emit audit events or verify authority. No `StorefrontVisualConsentEvent`
  entity is included here: its complete snapshot, proposal context/correlation and transaction
  belong to the next persistence tranche, separate from `StorefrontPublishingConsent`.

## Required before server integration or activation

1. Attach the state to `StorefrontProfile` together with the Master-only nullable columns, explicit
   bounded mapping, all-null/all-complete CHECK
   (including nonempty content), technical rowversion and append-only visual-consent journal.
   No private-classification backfill, CGU copy, tenant migration or reuse of tenant `AuditService`.
2. In dedicated owner handlers, derive tenant, active actor and UTC time from the server. Freshly
   re-read effective permission/membership and suspension, not only old JWT claims or cached
   security stamp. Withdrawal while suspended still requires authority; it never lifts suspension
   or relaxes the generic branding `UpdateProfile` prohibition.
3. Revalidate the exact current proposal, effective catalogue links and supported/authorized
   editorial revision. Syntactically valid arbitrary, retired or revoked references must fail.
   Reclassification only changes a suggestion. Keep an accepted old revision only while it stays
   active/supported/authorized, including N−1; otherwise project neutral/HTML without changing proof.
4. Check a concurrency precondition before domain mutation, **including no-ops**. Stale requests
   return 409 with a fresh proposal, never a silent overwrite. Domain `Result<bool>` distinguishes
   changes on the current loaded aggregate, not HTTP retry safety: replaying an old acceptance
   after withdrawal must fail the server precondition, not resurrect consent. Serialize/check
   races among acceptance, withdrawal, branding, moderation and owner permission changes.
5. In one Master transaction, save a changed profile and its immutable audit snapshot (previous
   identity/revision/terms on withdrawal, fresh withdrawal actor/time, proposal context/correlation).
   Audit failure must roll back the mutation. No-op repeats do not refresh proof or append duplicate
   consent events. Preserve authorization checks for no-ops. A returned `true` is not persisted audit.
6. Replace unsafe detached full-aggregate updates as needed; prove old/new binary coexistence and
   rowversion handling across all existing storefront commands. Do not deploy aggregate attachment
   without its Master schema changes.
7. Use a dedicated public allowlist projector: optional visual identity only when consent and
   current availability permit, with existing publication filters. Never expose actor/time/terms,
   private classification or raw entities. No public field is added at this checkpoint.

## Qualification boundary

`StorefrontVisualConsentTests` exercises absent/complete standalone state, rejected atomic
replacement, explicit acceptance, idempotence and the supplied-status suspension guard. Tests
with unchanged legacy fixtures check that neither acceptance nor withdrawal mutates their state;
this is not an integrated profile/consent workflow. Existing storefront domain tests remain
applicable. Test execution/results are reported separately, not implied by their presence.

V03 is **not closed**: actual HTTP permissions, stale proposals, concurrency, SQL CHECK and audit
rollback require real API/SQL tests. V01 public isolation/allowlists and V12 N/N−1 projection and
rollback are also future integration gates; domain tests cannot certify them. Graphics rollback
must never restore a database, run a down migration, erase recent proof or resurrect withdrawn consent.
